<h1>The Three Main File Types</h1>
  <p>There are three main types of image files, and each one can be used and can work better in certain situations.</p>
<h1>GIF Tags</h1>
  <p>GIFs are well known for being short video clips in an image, but not all GIFs move. Furthermore, GIFs are only limited to 256 colors, rather than the millions needed to make a picture as life like as possible. While GIFs don't work well for some images, they can work great for images with large areas of solid colors.</p>
<h1>JPEG Tags</h1>
  <p>JPEGS are often the best option when it comes to images with high gradients and many shadows, in other words, very complex images. This is because JPEGS have millions of color options, so one does not have to worry about a restricted color gradient.</p>
<h1>PNG Tags</h1>
  <p>There are different types of PNGs, PNG-8 and PNG-24. PNG-8 is very similar to a GIF, in that the color options are limited. With PNG-24, however, there are many more options in terms of color and they can be used for more complex images.
