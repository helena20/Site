<h1>The Three Main File Types</h1>
  <p>There are three main types of image files, and each one can be used and can work better in certain situations.</p>
<h1>GIF Tags</h1>
  <p>GIFs are well known for being short video clips in an image, but not all GIFs move. Furthermore, GIFs are only limited to 256 colors, rather than the millions needed to make a picture as lifelike as possible. While GIFs don't work well for some images, they can work great for images with large areas of solid colors.</p>
<h1>JPEG Tags</h3>
  <p>JPEGS are often the best option when it comes to images with high gradients and many shadows, in other words, very complex images.
