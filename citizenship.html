 <h1>What Makes a Good Citizen?</h1>
 <p> Citizenship is defined as both "the status of being a citizen" and "the quality of an individual's response to membership in a community." There are many different traits that define good citizenship, including honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage. Honesty is important for a good citizen because it builds trust in a community, and can make sure that people are treated fairly.

  <li>Compassion is important, because as a citizen of a place or community, compassion brings people together and can help build strong and stable relationships with strengthen the community.</li>
  <li>Respect is important for citizens because when people respect the people around them, there is a feeling of equality and balance, and people will feel better about themselves, preventing conflict.</li>
  <li>Responsibility is important for citizens because all citizens have different responsibilities that they have to take care of, along with responsibilities that help a larger group.</li>
  <li Courage is also important for citizens. People can be cruel and offensive, but having courage and standing up for what's right can show strength in a group, and having the courage to fight for one's community makes a good citizen.</li>

 <h2>What else makes a good citizen?</h2>
 <p>A citizen should also be hardworking. This is because any person from any community should always work hard for what they want, and if they don't they slow down themselves, and make life harder on the community. When citizens in a community or place are all hardworking, the society is more likely to prosper, because combined with resources, many hardworking people working together can create a strong community.
 <h3>Acts of Citizenship</h3>
 <p>Recently, I have many acts of citizenship on my swim team, when people on the team go to the end of the lane and cheer for the person swimming. This simple act is an act of good citizenship in that people were being supportive of their community and peers, and were being respectful and compassionate, among other things.
